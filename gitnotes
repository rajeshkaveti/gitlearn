…or create a new repository on the command line


echo "# gitlearn" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajeshkaveti/gitlearn.git
git push -u origin master


…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajeshkaveti/gitlearn.git
git push -u origin master


Pushing to remote
git push origin master

git fetch origin fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from)
it.git fetch command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of
your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.

Use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch


GIT TAG

it has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important. Typically people use this functionality to
mark release points (v1.0, and so on).

git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

git branch testing

This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.

git branch iss53
git checkout iss53
git push --set-upstream origin iss53

git checkout -b hotfix
you change the file

Then you merge with master
git checkout master
get merge hotfix
